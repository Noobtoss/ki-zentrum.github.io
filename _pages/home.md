# Our mission

The Center for Artificial Intelligence (KIZ) was founded by Tobias Bocklet and Korbinian Riedhammer to work on problem-specific solutions using machine learning and software engineering.
We focus on two main lines of research:

- Speech and language processing in the context of healthcare
- Machine learning for industry use cases and applications
